# Phoenix for Rails Developers

This is my sandbox for the codebase of the book
[Phoenix for Rails Developers][] ([book code repo][]).

Changes made:

- Update to Phoenix 1.6 and re-format codebase according to its formatter
- Add in some TDD-related mix packages
- Perform some personal-style code refactoring
